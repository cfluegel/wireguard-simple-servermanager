# wireguard-simple-servermanager
Simple Script to manage the configuration files of a simple wireguard server setup

## What is the goal 
I was fed up by how I ran my private wireguard server. I used it for accessing my private systems over 
unsecure networks, e.g. public wifi 

I occasionally add new clients to the network and it was tedious. Now I can generate all the configs 
(client and server) in one go and transfer the files to every place where it is necessary. 

The creation and preparation of the configuration files should be kept in a secure space. Like an encrypted 
hard disk space. 

## not finished 
- [] add a field to the client list that maps it to a specific server 
- [] secure the configurations files with some kind of encryption
